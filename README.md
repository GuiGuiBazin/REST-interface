# REST-interface

REST is a jupyter interface that helps the user to assess the application of rules-based method, regarding entities of interest highlighted in a corpus. 

In information extraction tasks, both machine learning and rules are available methods. Although the two processes are well-known and used, there is no obvious way or good practice to decide which one is the most appropriate for each project. 

Using highlights from the BRAT annotation tool, REST is part of an approach to evaluate a rules-based system quickly.
